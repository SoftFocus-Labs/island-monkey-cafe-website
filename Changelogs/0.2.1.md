# Changelog

## 0.2.1

### Fixed
- Navigation dropdown (mobile) and "Which type of event are you hosting?" dropdown now overlay content instead of pushing/expanding the page, functioning as classic dropdown menus
- Mobile navigation dropdown now has a working backdrop blur effect matching the navigation bar (moved mobile menu outside `<nav>` to avoid parent `backdrop-filter` blocking child blur)
- Mobile navigation dropdown shadow is no longer clipped by `overflow-hidden` on the animation container

### Changed
- Removed "VIEW THE GALLERY" button from the Our Story section
- Updated menu item price color from `#ab8d09` to `#245556`
- Updated event type dropdown hover effect: options now highlight with `#183a3b` background and `#ffffff` text, with the hover background filling the full width of the dropdown

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` with project guidance for Claude Code
